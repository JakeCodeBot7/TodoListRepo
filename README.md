This is a simple To-Do List Android app developed as a school project using Java. The app allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, with a clean and responsive UI built using Android Studio.

It demonstrates core Android development concepts such as activity lifecycle management, RecyclerViews, custom adapters, and local data persistence using SQLite.

The goal of the project was to build a functional productivity app while gaining experience with Java, Android SDK, and mobile UI design.
